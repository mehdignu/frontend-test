# Lykon - Front-end Engineer Test

Hello and thanks for taking the time to try out the Front-end Engineer test. ðŸ‘‹

The goal of this assignment is to build an app using React to consume a list of blood tests.
Our criterias to evaluate your test are how clean is your code, how efficient was your solution and how sustainable it's.
Tests are also very important to us.

Please review the exercises first. If anything is unclear or confusing, please contact us and we will help clarify any issues.

Have fun!

## Requirements

- You _MUST_ use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- You _MUST_ write tests
- Your code _MUST_ be in English (variable names, comments etc..)
- You _MAY_ use as many libraries as you like, but we recommend trying to stick to the standard library

## Challenge

You will need to consume a simple API endpoint `http://localhost:4000/tests` that will provide you a list of blood tests.

To run this API please install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and run the command `$ docker-composer up`.

We would like you to consume this API and dispose this data in two pages:

- Blood test list
- Blood test result

The test list must be ordered by date.
The result page must display a percentage bar represented by the wireframe below:

As a reference use our style guide at https://www.lykon.de/ for colors and layout.

When you are done please send a `.zip` with your project to frontend-tests@lykon.com

**Thanks for your time, we look forward to hearing from you!**
